# The-Hunted

This is an old, essentially abandoned project for a multiplayer game about saving a tortured forest of animal spirits from their anger. The project was made in Unity, version 2021.3.9.
I ran into some issues with the SRP system and my project never got back to a nicely rendering state in HDRP, which I needed for several rendering features I intended to use. In the frustration I gave up on it and move to Flax Engine several months later.

This project may have a redo in the future using Flax Engine, but I'd like to leave this version public to share some multiplayer code I wrote.

This repository contains only scripts to avoid licensing issues, so this project will of course not work. All code is mine though, so I have included it in this repository.
